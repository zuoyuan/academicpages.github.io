Aspect-based opinion mining is finding elaborate opinions towards a subject such as a product or an event. With explosive growth of opinionated texts on the Web, mining aspect-level opinions has become a promising means for online public opinion analysis. In particular, the boom of various types of online media provides diverse yet complementary information, bringing unprecedented opportunities for cross media aspect-opinion mining. Along this line, we propose CAMEL, a novel topic model for complementary aspect-based opinion mining across asymmetric collections. CAMEL gains information complementarity by modeling both common and specific aspects across collections, while keeping all the corresponding opinions for contrastive study. An auto-labeling scheme called AME is also proposed to help discriminate between aspect and opinion words without elaborative human labeling, which is further enhanced by adding word embedding-based similarity as a new feature. Moreover, CAMEL-DP, a nonparametric alternative to CAMEL is also proposed based on coupled Dirichlet Processes. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-collection reviews data demonstrate the superiority of our methods to competitive baselines. This is particularly true when the information shared by different collections becomes seriously fragmented. Finally, a case study on the public event “2014 Shanghai Stampede” demonstrates the practical value of CAMEL for real-world applications.
